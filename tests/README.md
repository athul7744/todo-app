# Test Suites

This folder holds the project's Vitest suites and lightweight test helpers.

## Layout

- `tests/notes/` — notes-specific logic and write-path tests.
- `tests/tasks/` — task-specific test entry points and notes about where task suites belong.
- `tests/tracker/` — tracker-specific test entry points and notes about where tracker suites belong.
- `tests/shared/` — reusable fixtures, builders, and assertions shared across app groups.

## Current Notes Suites

- `tests/notes/markdown-clipboard.test.ts`
  Verifies mdast-backed markdown clipboard parsing and block conversion for pasted note content, including nested children, task list markers, blockquote and heading routing, and single-block replacement decisions.

- `tests/notes/block-editor-keyboard.test.ts`
  Covers the notes editor keyboard decision layer for Enter, Shift+Enter, Tab, arrow navigation, and Backspace behavior under the plain-text-first editing model.

- `tests/notes/block-editor-structure.test.ts`
  Covers structural block outcomes for delete focus, merge planning, child reparenting, and indent/outdent placement.

- `tests/notes/notes-content.test.ts`
  Covers note document normalization, legacy text fallback, serialization, plain-text extraction, and merge edge cases for note content.

- `tests/notes/notes-tree.test.ts`
  Covers nested block tree construction plus visible-order neighbor lookups used by block navigation and merge behavior.

- `tests/notes/notes-write.test.ts`
  Covers note block write behavior around batched queued creates, retry after failed flush, update-before-flush, delete-before-flush, and immediate starter-page creation.

- `tests/notes/useNoteBlockActions.dom.test.ts`
  Runs jsdom-backed integration coverage for `useNoteBlockActions`, including merge-into-previous behavior with child reparenting and delete focus behavior for the first visible block.

## Usage

- `npm test` — one-shot node-based Vitest run.
- `npm run test:dom` — jsdom-backed integration run.
- `npm run test:watch` — watch mode while developing.
- `node .\\node_modules\\vitest\\vitest.mjs run tests/notes` — focused node-based notes test run when working on notes behavior.
- `node .\\node_modules\\vitest\\vitest.mjs run --config vitest.dom.config.ts tests/notes/useNoteBlockActions.dom.test.ts` — focused DOM integration run for note action behavior.

Keep new tests close to the app area they protect, and move reusable builders or assertions into `tests/shared/` once they are used by more than one suite.
